大家可能都在網路的FW上看過賈伯斯的三個故事, 有很多個中文翻譯版本, 每一個的重點都在於”Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish”, 中文翻得很好, 求知若飢，虛心若愚, 但是很少有FW貼出了原文和影片, 今天在史丹利五的網站看到了youtube上有這一個2005年的影片,很仔細的聽了賈伯斯的三個故事, 真受用啊! 他的這三個故事不是畢業的時候才受用, 其實不管在人生的哪一個階段來聽, 都很有啟發性, 賈伯斯的英文演講功力向來很好, 大家可以看影片學英文囉! 英文原文稍微搜尋一下就找得到了 選校的時候難免有很多困惑, 想要請教前輩, 想要多問些問題, 但最重要的是你也有在聽自己的心, 如果光是聽一大堆別人的意見, 自己卻做不了主, 那麼也許應該自己先靜下來, 等聽見了自己的聲音之後, 再往那個方向去走吧! (呃~其實不光是選校, 人生中有很多個片刻都需要這樣子做的) 賈伯斯的三個故事告訴我們 Again, you can’t connect the dots looking forward; (心得:沒人能夠預料自己未來的人生, 選校並不決定整個人生, 因此如果你相信這個學校適合自己, 你就去, 反之亦然) you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. (心得:嗯. 收到rejection的感覺跟這個差不多) Don’t lose faith. I’m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You’ve got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. (心得:其中最重要的應該還是love what you do) If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don’t settle. Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. (心得:不要活在別人的想法裡, 親友眼中的名校不見得就適合你, 要自己做功課, 要自己比其他人都了解那個學校, 你再做決定) Don’t let the noise of other’s opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.
