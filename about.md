This blog is [hosted in git](https://blog.invisiblethings.org/2015/02/09/my-new-git-based-blog.html), which comes with
various advantages:

- The integrity and authenticity of this site can be checked by verifying that the commits are signed by my GPG key.
  Commits are also timestamped with [opentimestamps](https://opentimestamps.org/).

- It is possible to check it out locally and read it offine, I've aimed to make most posts readable with a text editor.
  You can also build and view the site locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/awesome-doge/awesome-doge.github.io
cd awesome-doge.github
jekyll serve
```

- You can propose changes, say to fix typos, using [Pull Requests](https://github.com/laanwj/laanwj.github.io/pulls) on
  github.
