In 2014, I started blockchain technology research, and in 2015 I entered the Academia Sinica to do blockchain research and participated in four projects of the Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of China.

Since 2014, 10 papers have been completed, 4 of which are IEEE international conferences, and two have won the best paper awards. I studied at Peking University in 2016 and completed my three years of study in two years.

My research interests include bitcoin, blockchain, onion networks, cryptography, firewalls, Minecraft and Raspberry Pi.
